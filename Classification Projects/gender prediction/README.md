Gender Classification


While I was practicing machine learning, I wanted to create a dataset that is closely aligned to the real world scenario and gives better results to whet my appetite on this domain This data set provides simple way to classify the gender with some of the given 7 features that are

1)long_hair - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "long hair" and 0 is"not longhair".                2)forehead_width_cm - This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead. 3)forehead_height_cm - This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.        4)nose_wide - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "wide nose" and 0 is "not wide nose". 5)nose_long - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "Long nose" and 0 is "not long nose". 6)lips_thin - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "thin lips" while 0 is "Not thin lips".               7)distance_nose_to_lip_long - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "long distance between nose and lips" while 0 is "short distance between nose and lips".

from these features i want to predict that the gender is male or female
